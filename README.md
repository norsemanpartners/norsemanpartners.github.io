# Website Repo for Norseman Partners website
Author: Ari Webb

## Motivation:

This website is for the new money management company called Norseman Partners. This website was made almost exclusively by Ari Webb, with minimal help from teammates in terms of writing content/graphical designs.

## Codebase:

The codebase is in the Bootstrap framework. It was originally inspired by a Simple Bootstrap framework sample website. It is only 1 page. All styles are stored in styles.css, a couple of scripts for scrolling are in scripts.js. Assets contains all of the pictures.

## Custom Domain and Hosting:

This webpage is hosted on Github pages for free. Pages only supports static websites, so the contact us form uses an external service called formspree.io, which as of 11/10/2022 handles 1000 forms per month for free. The current domain name is norsemanpartners.com, which Ari Webb purchased on Namecheap for ~$10 per year in 11/2022.

I took the folowing steps to find a domain name and setup Github Pages to forward to that domain.

1. Choose a domain name.
2. Purchase the domain name. I used [namecheap][namecheap].
3. Configure a new CNAME record through GH pages. If you used namecheap, instructions are [here][ncdns]
4. Create the custom domain through GH. Find general info about this [here][ghpcustom] and specific instructions [here][ghpins]
